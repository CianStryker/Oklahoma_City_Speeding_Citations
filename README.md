# Oklahoma City Speeding Citations
- One of the problem sets for my class GOV 1005 "Data" at Harvard University was to create an animated visualization of citations given in Oklahoma City. The idea was to use R to do some GIS mapping. I decided to record all "high speed" citations given between 2011 and 2016. The other point of this assignment was to use a combination of R scripts and R markdown documents to create files, organize materials, and finally create a Shiny app. For that reason I use a R script and R markdown to create the map itself. 

The website can be viewed online [here](https://cianstryker.shinyapps.io/Speeding_Citations_Oklahoma_City/)

# File Guide
- All code for the website can be found under the "Shiny" folder.
- Data can be found under "clean-data".
- The gif can be found under the "graphics" folder.
- All code for making the map is split between "prep.R" and "map.Rmd", although "prep.R" should be loaded before "map.Rmd".
